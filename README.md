# ArchScripts
Various utilities for ArchLinux

+ <b>steam_native</b>: You should put this script in /usr/bin/. This a 
script used for launching steam using linux native libraries instead of 
the ones that come packed with steam

+ <b>fixX.sh</b>: Those are a few lines used for reseting the X server. 
I use it when my laptop is overheated and there are graphical artifacts 

+ <b>bashrc</b>: This is the .bashrc I use for my terminal. It features 256 color mode, autocd, and git prompt among others. Default <code>$editor</code> is set to <code>VIM</code>
